* Create a manifest with two resources in it. Pick any resources you like (file, user, package,...).

* Lookup how to force ordering in puppet.

* Arrange the resources to be created in an order of your choosing which is *different* from
the order in which they appear in the manifest file.

* Apply the manifest and rejoice.
