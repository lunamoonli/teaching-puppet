	Imagine we have software called "foo" made up of two files:
		/usr/bin/foo <- this is the actualy executable
		/etc/foo.conf <- this is the config file for the executable
				without it the program crashes

	We want the following:
		**IF** we install software "bar" we want to change the behaviour of foo.

		If the installtion of "bar" actually changes "/etc/foo.conf" then we
		a problem.
		Why? Because it will change the md5 (checksum) of the /etc/foo.conf file
		which will trigger a warning.

	What if we have another software called "zoo" and installing it should *ALSO*"
		change the behaviour of "foo"


				foo
				/etc/foo.conf which includes /etc/foo.d/*
				/etc/foo.d

			bar		zoo
			/etc/foo.d/bar		/etc/foo.d/zoo
